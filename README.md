Data visualisation skills (aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis) were used  to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

### Instructions

The main tasks is to visualise and analyse the real-estate data in Jupyter notebook, include:

#### Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year

* What’s the overall trend in housing units over the period that you’re analysing?

#### Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot

* Did any year experience a drop in the average sale price per square foot compared to the previous year?

* If so, did the gross rent increase or decrease during that year?

#### Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighbourhood

* For the Anza Vista neighbourhood, is the average sale price per square foot for 2016 more or less than the price that’s listed for 2012?

#### Build an Interactive Neighbourhood Map

* Which neighbourhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot?

#### Compose Data Story

* How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighbourhoods across San Francisco?

* What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighbourhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?
